# StudentPerformancePrediction-ML
This machine learning project investigates the key determinants of student academic achievement.
By employing a dataset containing diverse student attributes—including nationality, grade level, and engagement metrics such as hands raised, attendance, and study duration—we built and evaluated several classification models.
The primary objective was to accurately predict student grade categories and determine which features have the most predictive power. Model performance and the relative importance of these factors are demonstrated through visual aids, including comparative graphs and detailed confusion matrices for each classifier.
